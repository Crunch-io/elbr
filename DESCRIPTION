Title: A Tidy Reader for Load Balancer Logs
Description: Amazon Web Services' 'Elastic Load Balancer' emits log files in a
    defined, space-delimited text file format. This package provides tools for
    reading and exploring those logs. There is an individual file reader, as
    well as a 'dplyr' backend that enables you to work easily with recursive
    directories of many log files. All functions are designed to be as fast and
    efficient as possible, only reading in and stacking together the rows and
    columns of data you need.
